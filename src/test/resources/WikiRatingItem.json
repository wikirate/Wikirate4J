  "about": "<p>The company should offer [[https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2017-indicators/#tos|<strong>terms of service</strong>]] that are [[https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2017-indicators/#easytofind|<strong>easy to find</strong>]] and [[https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2017-indicators/#easytounderstand|<strong>easy to understand</strong>]].<br><br>A company’s terms of service outline the relationship between the user and the company. The terms contain rules for what activities and content users are permitted to engage in and share on a company’s services, as such these terms directly impact if and how users can exercise their freedom of expression rights. Companies can also take action against users for violating the conditions described in the terms. Given this, we expect companies to ensure that users can easily locate these terms and understand what they mean.</p>",
