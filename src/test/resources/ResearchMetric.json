An organization can consume energy in various forms, such as fuel, electricity, heating, cooling or steam. Energy can be self-generated or purchased from external sources and it can come from renewable sources (such as wind, hydro or solar) or from non-renewable sources (such as coal, petroleum or natural gas).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">Using energy more efficiently and opting for renewable energy sources is essential for combating climate change and for lowering an organization’s overall environmental footprint. The disclosures in this Standard can provide information about an organization’s impacts related to energy, and how it manages them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-renewable energy source</strong> - energy source that cannot be replenished, reproduced, grown or generated in a short time period through ecological cycles or agricultural processes. Non-renewable energy sources can include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>fuel distilled from petroleum or crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil;</li>\r\n<li>natural gas, such as compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG);</li>\r\n<li>fuels extracted from natural gas processing and petroleum refining, such as butane, propane, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG);</li>\r\n<li>coal;</li>\r\n<li>nuclear power</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">In 2018, the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines were superseded by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI standards). For this metric, the code </span><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">G4-EN3 is used in company reporting prior to 2018</span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">, and the </span><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">new GRI 302-1 code used in reporting from 2018 onwards</span><span style=\"font-size: 15.2px;\">.
